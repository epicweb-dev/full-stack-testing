# Playwright

👨‍💼 One of the most important features of our app is the search functionality
you'll find on <LinkToApp to="/users" />. So we're going to put our first test
there. Here's what we're going to test:

- Go to the home page
- Type "kody" in the search input at the top and hit search
- Verify we went to the user's page and that kody appears as an item in the list
  of results
- Type something we know shouldn't show any results
- Verify no results are displayed

We also want to make sure that if they type in a search term that doesn't match
any user we display the right message.

<callout-info>
	In this exercise, we're going to rely on the fact that we have a user in our
	seeded database called "Kody". But you really don't want to do that! We'll
	improve upon this in the next step.
</callout-info>

It could help to have the <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/index.tsx" /> file
open as a reference as you try to write the test. That said, Kody 🐨 will be in
the <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/search.test.ts" /> file to guide you
step-by-step here.

🧝‍♂️ I've already configured Playwright for us. You'll find the config
in <InlineFile file="playwright.config.ts" />. If you want to learn more about
the configuration options, knock yourself out with
[this reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

<callout-info>
	Playwright-specific commands must be run in `playground` directory. If you're
	currently in the workshop's root directory, simply run `cd playground` to get
	there.
</callout-info>

To start running the test, open up a terminal in the `playground` directory and
run:

```sh nonumber
npx playwright test --ui
```

This will start your dev server and open up the playwright UI. If you've not
seen it before, definitely take some time to learn about all the options in the
UI before getting started.
