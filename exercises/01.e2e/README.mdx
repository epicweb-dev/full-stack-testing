# End-to-End

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/end-to-end/intro-to-ent-to-end" />

Whether you know it or not, you are already testing your application. Whenever
run your app after making a change, you are testing it. For example:

- You change the color of a button, you run the app, you see if the button is
  the new color.
- You change the checkout flow, run the app, and see if the checkout flow is
  the new one.

We call this **manual testing** and it works well when you're just getting
started with a project or feature, but the problem is after a while you realize
that it's impossible ensure your app is working with every change you make.
Especially when you make a change that affects multiple parts of the app. In
fact, we often affect parts of the app with our changes without realizing it,
so even if you were to test every change, you would still miss things.

Whenever we run into manual processes in the tech world, we often find it is
more fun (and efficient/profitable) to write software that automates the
process. What if instead of clicking around the app to test it, we could
write a little script that does this for us. Then when we make a change, we
simply run the script and it will tell us if the app is working or not.

I like to think of these scripts as "thousands of little Kent's" running around
checking that I didn't break anything. That's the beauty of software development
in general.

One challenge with automating any process is ensuring that you are actually
automating the process or improving upon it. Normally this isn't too big of a
problem, but in the testing world, it's actually a bit of a challenge:

<callout-warning>
	You're using a computer program to make certain that a human can use your app.
</callout-warning>

You're not trying to make sure that the **computer** can use your app, but a
human. But you're using a computer to do it. You will find yourself fighting
against this reality constantly as you write automated tests.

So, whenever you're trying to decide how to write a test, take a step back and
think how you would do it if you were giving a list of instructions to a human
tester instead of a script to a computer. Remember:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you. - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

And confidence is what we're going for when we're writing tests. Also, it's
important to know who is _using_ your software (and who is not) so you know how
they use it. For more on this, read
["Avoid the Test User"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).

## What is a Test?

<callout-success>
	A test is code that throws an error when something is wrong.
</callout-success>

For example:

```ts
// here's the thing we want to test 👇
const sum = (a, b) => a + b

// here's the test 👇
const expected = 3
const actual = sum(1, 2)
if (actual !== expected) {
	throw new Error(`The sum was ${actual} but it should have been ${expected}`)
}
```

That's it. That's a test. Modern testing frameworks do a lot to make writing and
running tests easier, but that's the gist of it.

## What is End to End Testing?

There are various tools and strategies for testing your application. Each has
their own benefits and drawbacks. We're going to start with the End to End
testing strategy because it does the best job representing how your app is
actually used.

"End to End" is referring to the fact that we're testing the app from the
user's experience all the way to our backend components. If you're just getting
started with testing, it may feel obvious, but there are lower level tests where
you often test individual components or even make fake versions of things. We'll
discuss these in more detail later.

<callout-success>
	Think about the way you're current manually testing your app. An "End to End
	test" is just doing that with an automation tool.
</callout-success>

## Playwright

We'll use a testing tool called [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to write
our tests. Playwright is a browser automation framework that allows you control
the browser and interact with it in ways that are very similar to your users.

[The Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) do a good job
demonstrating how to get started with Playwright. Most of the time you spend
with playwright will be in writing tests, so I suggest you familiarize yourself
with the [writing tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) docs page.

Here's an example from the playwright docs:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')

	// Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
	await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/)
})

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')

	// Click the get started link.
	await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click()

	// Expects the URL to contain intro.
	await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*intro/)
})
```

A few important notes about that test:

1. `page.goto` is like the user entering a URL in the address bar and hitting
   "enter". Because that's annoying, we can skip the full URL and just provide a
   pathname by configuring a
   [`baseURL`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver#adding-a-baseurl) in
   the playwright config. With that setup, you can simply do `page.goto('/')` to
   go to the root of your app.
2. `page.getByRole` is called a [locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators).
   It's your primary mechanism for finding elements on the page to interact
   with. Playwright has several queries/locator functions, and many are based on
   [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
   (by [me](https://kentcdodds.com) 👋).
   ["Roles"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)
   are a built-in feature of the browser used primarily by assistive
   technologies. Most of the time, the roles are implicit (you're not usually
   supposed to use the `role` attribute). By querying using roles, you're also
   testing (a **part** of) your application's accessibility to people using
   these technologies.

### Playwright UI

Playwright has a really handy feature called
[UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#introducing-ui-mode-preview)
which allows you to see what Playwright is doing in the browser and review each
step of the test. You'll want to spend a little bit of time getting familiar
with the features of UI mode.

### Playwright Fixtures

I'm sorry to be the barer of bad news... But we've got another term overload
incoming... Here's how I define a "fixture":

> A fixed state of the software under test used as a baseline for running test
> cases.

This often includes database states, configurations, or objects initialized
to specific values. It can even include binary files like images or audio/video
files.

[Here's how playwright defines a "fixture"](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures):

> Test fixtures are used to establish environment for each test, giving the test
> everything it needs and nothing else.

It continues:

> Test fixtures are isolated between tests. With fixtures, you can group tests
> based on their meaning, instead of their common setup.

If you squint, we're talking about the same thing, but really what Playwright
fixtures feel more like is a way to set up a special environment for a test.
Almost like a way to encapsulate the setup and tear down of a test. So it's
more of a runtime thing.

Let's look at some code to get an idea of what we're talking about. First of
all, playwright ships with a bunch of fixtures by default:

```tsx
test('this is an example', async ({
	// these are where you get fixtures from
	page, // <-- this is a fixture
	browser, // <-- so is this
}) => {
	// here's my test
})
```

You can make your own fixtures as well. Honestly, the API is a little funny, and
I don't like the way they teach about fixtures in the docs, so I'm going to show
you myself.

First it makes sense if you think of it in three phases:

1. Do stuff before the test runs
2. Get the stuff the test will **use** when they **use** my fixture
3. Do stuff after the test runs

In the next exercise, Kellie is going to write a fixture for you for the
onboarding flow. In that we need to create a user object, then we need to hand
that over to the test (with a password), then we need to delete the user after
the test runs. Here's how you use it:

```tsx
test('onboarding with link', async ({ page, getOnboardingData }) => {
	const onboardingData = getOnboardingData()

	// ... do stuff with the test...
})
```

Here's how that's implemented:

```tsx
const test = base.extend({
	getOnboardingData: async ({}, use) => {
		const userData = createUser()
		await use(() => {
			const onboardingData = {
				...userData,
				password: faker.internet.password(),
			}
			return onboardingData
		})
		await prisma.user
			.delete({ where: { username: userData.username } })
			.catch(() => {})
	},
})
```

First off, let me say the `{}` destructuring syntax is not a mistake. That
argument is where you access other fixtures. If you don't need any, you **must**
still include that argument and it must be empty. It's super weird, but you'll
get an error otherwise so just go with it.

Ok, so let's break this down:

**Do stuff before the test runs**:

```tsx
const userData = createUser()
```

This is pretty straightforward. Really, whatever you do before calling `use` is
the "before" stuff.

**Get the stuff the test will _use_ when they _use_ my fixture**:

```tsx
await use(() => {
	const onboardingData = {
		...userData,
		password: faker.internet.password(),
	}
	return onboardingData
})
```

This API is kinda funky. But basically, you pass to `use` whatever you want
the value of your fixture to be. So we're passing a function (which is why we
call it `getOnboardingData`), but we could also pass an object or whatever we
need.

Like I said, it's kinda funky. But it's a powerful API, so go with it.

**Do stuff after the test runs**:

```tsx
await prisma.user
	.delete({ where: { username: userData.username } })
	.catch(() => {})
```

Once the test is finished, we delete the user that was used to go through the
onboarding process. So because this comes after the `use` call, it's the "after"
stuff.

Hopefully that makes sense. You'll be making one in this exercise (for inserting
a user in the database directly), so you'll get a chance to try it out yourself.

Also, I did leave off the TypeScript generic, so here's that bit now:

```tsx
const test = base.extend<{
	getOnboardingData(): {
		username: string
		name: string
		email: string
		password: string
	}
}>({
	getOnboardingData: async ({}, use) => {
		// ...etc
	},
})
```

The value of the generic is the type of the fixture (whatever you pass to
`use`).
