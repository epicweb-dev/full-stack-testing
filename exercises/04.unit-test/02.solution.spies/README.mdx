# Spies (mocks)

👨‍💼 Great! Now our test output is cleaner! But do you remember our user search
E2E test where we were doing the cleanup at the end of the test? Remember the
problem that caused?

The problem it caused was if the test failed, the cleanup never ran. We reached
for playwright's `test.afterEach` to solve this. We've got a similar problem
here with our cleanup and we can solve it in a similar way with vitest. We'll do
that next.
