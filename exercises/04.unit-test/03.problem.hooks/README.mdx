# Hooks

👨‍💼 So we've got some cleanup at the end of our test and that's going to be
problematic if that test fails. Vitest has the same concept of `before`/`after`
`Each`/`All` as Playwright:

```ts
import { beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, afterAll } from 'vitest'

beforeAll(async () => {
	// do something before all tests
})

afterAll(async () => {
	// do something after all tests
})

beforeEach(async () => {
	// do something before each test
})

afterEach(async () => {
	// do something after each test
})
```

	Of course those functions don't have to be `async` if you aren't doing
	anything asynchronous in them
</callout-muted>

🦉 As mentioned, I typically prefer to not do setup in testing hooks, but this
is an exception. There are in fact, no tests where I want the real
`console.error` to be called. So by using a `beforeEach` hook, we can mock the
`console.error` for every test and restore it after it's finished. Additionally,
it would be a good idea to make certain there were no unexpected calls to
`console.error` (we don't want to swallow errors and miss actual problems!).

Sadly, this is going to require a bit more work than what we were doing before,
but it'll be better this way, I promise.

Oh, also, that `mockRestore()` idea is such a good idea generally that there's
even a configuration option to do it by default. So we can remove that call and
add that in <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts" />. This will actually ensure
our cleanup of the mock functions always run after each test which is exactly
what we want.

	vitest replaced `SpyInstance` with `MockInstance` so the videos will use
	`SpyInstance`, but you'll be using `MockInstance`.
