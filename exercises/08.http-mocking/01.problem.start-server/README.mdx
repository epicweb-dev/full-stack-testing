# Start Mock Server

👨‍💼 We're going to test our "Login with GitHub" integration. We've already
implemented the HTTP mocks in <InlineFile file="tests/mocks/github.ts" />. But
we're not actually loading those mocks yet. So we need you to update the tests
to load and start the mocks server.

Additionally, we're going to have you create the request and call the loader.
You may want to review the loader
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" />. You'll
notice it expects a few things on the request object. Here's a quick summary of
what's required:

1. The `request.url` should be `https://www.epicstack.dev/auth/github/callback`
1. search param called `state` (can just be a random string)
1. search param called `code` (can just be a random string)
1. A header called `cookie` which includes the `sessionStorage` with
   `oauth2:state` set to the same value as the `state` search param.
1. Method `GET`

🧝‍♂️ Because `sessionStorage.commitSession()` returns a `set-cookie` header for a
response, and you need a `cookie` header for a request, I've made a utility for
you that does the conversion for you. You'll find it at the bottom of the test
file. It's called `convertSetCookieToCookie`.

```sh nonumber
npx vitest auth.github
```
