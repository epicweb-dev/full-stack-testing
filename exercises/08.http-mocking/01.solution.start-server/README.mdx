# Start Mock Server

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/web-application-testing/http-mocking/github-sign-in-callback/solution" />

👨‍💼 Since we have the mock server going, when our OAuth integration mocks
in <InlineFile file="tests/mocks/github.ts" /> will handle requests made by the
`remix-auth-github` during our tests. But that's just got our happy-path stuff.
We need to test the unhappy-path stuff too. Let's get to that next.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to add another utility for us called `assertToastSent`. Basically,
there are several spots
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" /> where we
redirect the user and pop up a toast for them. We want to test that
functionality. You can write it yourself if you like (check
out <InlineFile file="app/utils/toast.server.ts" /> for how it works), or you
can <DiffLink> check my changes</DiffLink>.
