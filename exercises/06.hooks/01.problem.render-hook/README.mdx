# Render Hook

👨‍💼 We've got ourselves a hook we want to test! The `useDoubleCheck`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/misc.tsx" />.

If you want to see it in action, check
out <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.two-factor.disable.tsx" />.

Here's a quick example:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
	const dc = useDoubleCheck()
	return (
		<Form method="POST" action="/feed/lions">
			<button
				{...dc.getButtonProps({
					// put custom props here,
					// like an onClick, etc...
				})}
			>
				{dc.doubleCheck ? 'Are you sure?' : 'Feed the lions'}
			</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

The first time it's clicked, it calls `preventDefault` on the event and updates
the `doubleClick` value. The second time it's clicked, it submits the form.

In both cases, any custom `onClick` handler will be called (which can then check
the `event.defaultPrevented` value to see if the event was prevented).

I want you to try both `renderHook` and `TestComponent` for this exercise.
Sometimes you just have to do it both ways and see which you dislike the least.
😅

Let's start with `renderHook`. Here's a reminder of how to use that API:

```tsx filename=use-counter.test.tsx
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { useCounter } from './use-counter'

test('increments and decrements', () => {
	const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0))

	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
	act(() => result.current.increment())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)
	act(() => result.current.decrement())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

Remember the warning before:

<callout-danger>
	Be sure to always reference values off of `result.current`. Do not destructure
	values off of `result.current` and then reference them. This will lead you to
	referencing stale values and your tests won't work reliably.
</callout-danger>

## `vi.fn`

👨‍💼 In this exercise, you're going to need to use a mock function to pass as the
custom `onClick` handler to make sure it's called when the button is clicked.

Here's how you use `vi.fn` to create a mock function:

```ts
const myClickHandler = vi.fn()

// ... pass the mock function just like you would a regular function

expect(myClickHandler).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
// or
expect(myClickHandler).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
// or
expect(myClickHandler).toHaveBeenCalledWith('some', 'arguments')
// etc.
```
