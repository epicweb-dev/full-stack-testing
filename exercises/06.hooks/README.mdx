# Hooks

In React, we have a primitive that's even lower level than a component: a hook.

A hook is a function that uses other hooks. That's it. That's the definition of
a hook. But what makes it special regarding testing is if you try to call a hook
outside of a React component, React doesn't know what to do with it and will
error out on you.

But sometimes it can be really useful to test a hook in isolation for all the
same reasons we want to write lower-level tests. Primarily, if there's some
complex logic going on in the hook, it can be nice to test it directly rather
than indirectly through a component.

So `@testing-library/react` has a special function called
[`renderHook`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#renderhook)
that allows you to test a hook in isolation. Here's an example:

```tsx filename=use-counter.tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function useCounter(initialCount) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)

	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1)

	return { count, increment, decrement }
}
```

```tsx filename=use-counter.test.tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { useCounter } from './use-counter'

test('increments and decrements', () => {
	const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0))

	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
	act(() => result.current.increment())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)
	act(() => result.current.decrement())
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

## `result.current`

Due to the nature of JavaScript, it's _very important_ you always reference all
values off of `result.current` rather than doing what may seem more natural and
destructuring values off of `result.current` and using those. This is because
`result.current` is a reference to the current value of the hook. If you
destructure values off of it, then you're creating a new reference to the
values. This means that if you call a function that mutates the values, then
your destructured values will be out of date.

This is a common mistake that people make when testing hooks with this utility.

## Act

What's this `act` thing? To be short, it's a way to tell React that you're
performing an action that will cause a state change. This way, when you're done
with your action, React can flush all the state changes and re-render the
component. This is important because React is asynchronous, so if you don't tell
React that you're done with your action, it won't know when to flush the state
changes and re-render the component. If it doesn't re-render, then your next
line of code will be testing the old state, not the new state.

## Test Components

An alternative to using `renderHook` is to write your own `TestComponent`.
Here's how we would do that with the example above:

```tsx filename=use-counter.test.tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */
import { renderHook, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEventDefault from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { useState } from 'react'
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { useCounter } from './use-counter'

// https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/issues/1146
const userEvent = userEventDefault.default ?? userEventDefault

function TestComponent() {
	const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter(0)
	return (
		<div>
			<output>{count}</output>
			<button onClick={increment}>+</button>
			<button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
		</div>
	)
}

test('increments and decrements', async () => {
	const user = userEvent.setup()

	render(<TestComponent />)

	expect(screen.getByRole('status').textContent).toBe(0)
	await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: '+' }))
	expect(screen.getByRole('status').textContent).toBe(1)
	await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: '-' }))
	expect(result.current.count).toBe(0)
})
```

Interestingly, the TestComponent is actually what `renderHook` does, though it's
more generic and doesn't render any React elements. Making your own
`TestComponent` comes with the benefit of you being able to help use the
component in the way it's intended to be used by consumers of the hook. In some
cases this makes the test easier to understand.

## User Event

You may have noticed in our test component example that we're using
[`userEvent`](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro) to trigger
the increment and decrement. And we don't have to wrap those calls in `act`.
This is because `userEvent` will fire browser events in a way that simulates
a user interaction. This is a great way to test your components because it
ensures that your components are working as expected when a user interacts with
them.

The reason we don't need to wrap these in `act` is because `userEvent` actually
just calls
[`fireEvent`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events),
(a lower-level utility you rarely need) which in a React context is
automatically wrapped in `act` for you. So you never need to worry about
wrapping `fireEvent` or `userEvent` in `act` yourself. Incidentally, `render` is
also wrapped in `act`. So in fact you very _rarely_ need to use `act` directly.
