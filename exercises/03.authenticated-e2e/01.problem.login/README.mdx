# Page login

👨‍💼 We want to test the user 2FA functionality. Go ahead and follow the flow to
get a sense for what we're trying to test:

1. <LinkToApp to="/login">Login with a user</LinkToApp>
   (username: `kody`, password: `kodylovesyou`)
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />
1. On the settings page,
   <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor">Click "Enable 2FA"</LinkToApp>
1. On the 2FA page,
   <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor/verify">
   	click "Enable 2FA"
   </LinkToApp>
1. Scan the QR code with an authentication app (1Password/Google Authenticator).
   Or, you can check below for an alternative way to get the code.
1. Paste the code into the input field and click "Submit"
1. Go back to the <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" /> page
1. Click Logout
1. <LinkToApp to="/login">Login with the same user</LinkToApp>
1. You should be shown the verification page. Get the latest code and paste it
   into the input field.
1. You should be successfully logged in!

<summary>Alternative way to get the code</summary>

If you can't scan the QR code, create a temporary file and stick this in it:

```js
import { generateTOTP } from '@epic-web/totp'

// put the URL in this string:
const otpUriString = `PASTE_THE_URL_HERE`
// it should start with otpauth://totp/...

const otpUri = new URL(otpUriString)
const options = Object.fromEntries(otpUri.searchParams.entries())

console.log(generateTOTP(options).otp)
```

</details>

Phew! That's a lot of steps! Yeah, but E2E tests are intended to test common
user flows. They're less valuable when they're split up into tiny pieces. And
luckily for you, we've got Kellie 🧝‍♂️ who will do most of this for you if you
don't want to do it yourself. That way you can focus most of your attention on
the bits you're trying to learn.

Before we can do any of that though, we don't want the test to actually go
through the entire onboarding flow. That would be wasteful since we already have
a test that verifies that flow. So instead, we're going to programmatically
create a user and then log in with that user.

The key bits of this involve:

1. Create a new user (using your `insertNewUser` utility)
2. Create a session for that user (`prisma.session.create`)
3. Create a cookie for that session (`sessionStorage.getSession`)
4. Get that cookie value from the `set-cookie` header
5. Put that `cookie` value into the page via `page.context().addCookies`.

## Setting the cookie in the browser

Let's talk about step 5 first...

Playwright has
[an API](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-add-cookies)
for setting browser cookies. Here's a quick example:

```ts
await page.context().addCookies([
	{
		name: 'theme',
		sameSite: 'Lax',
		domain: 'localhost',
		path: '/',
		value: 'dark',
	},
])
```

Most of that should look relatively familiar. There are more configuration
options you can find in the docs. You want this configuration to match the
configuration you have for the cookie in the app. Remember, this is a bit like
a mock, so you want to make sure it resembles the real deal as much as possible.

You can set multiple cookies (just more objects in that array).

## Parsing the `set-cookie` header

Alright, let's talk about step 4. Check this out:

```ts nocopy
const result = await sessionStorage.commitSession(cookieSession)
// result looks something like this: en_session=eyJ2ZXJpZmllZC10aW1lIjoxNjkxNDQ1NDI1NjcwLCJzZXNzaW9uSWQiOiJjbGwxZzF2emIwMDAxcGNqNjkyNTB1ZnRuIn0%3D.%2Fzc%2BhFmBg1wPNiYE5nqS1hcXsZJFZwPrLQUf7BGZD1Q; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
```

Then the browser turns that into a `Cookie` header for its requests. So the
browser will just send this bit in the headers:

```txt nonumber nocopy nolang
Cookie: en_session=eyJ2ZXJpZmllZC10aW1lIjoxNjkxNDQ1NDI1NjcwLCJzZXNzaW9uSWQiOiJjbGwxZzF2emIwMDAxcGNqNjkyNTB1ZnRuIn0%3D.%2Fzc%2BhFmBg1wPNiYE5nqS1hcXsZJFZwPrLQUf7BGZD1Q;
```

So we need to extract that value from the `set-cookie` header and put it into
the browser's `Cookie` header. There's a library that can help us with this
called [`set-cookie-parser`](https://npm.im/set-cookie-parser) (as the author of
a library called "React Testing Library," I must say I approve of this obvious
name 😆).

```ts nocopy
import * as setCookieParser from 'set-cookie-parser'

const cookie = setCookieParser.parseString(
	await sessionStorage.commitSession(cookieSession),
)
cookie.name // => en_session
cookie.value // => eyJ2ZXJpZmllZC10aW1lIjoxNjkxNDQ1NDI1NjcwLCJzZXNzaW9uSWQiOiJjbGwxZzF2emIwMDAxcGNqNjkyNTB1ZnRuIn0%3D.%2Fzc%2BhFmBg1wPNiYE5nqS1hcXsZJFZwPrLQUf7BGZD1Q
cookie.sameSite // => Lax
// etc.
```

👨‍💼 Alright, enough with that! Let's go!

You'll just be working in <InlineFile file="test/e2e/2fa.test.ts" />, but you
may want to reference <InlineFile file="app/utils/session.server.ts" /> for the
cookie config and <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> for how to
create the session and working with the cookie.

```sh nonumber
npx playwright test --ui
```
