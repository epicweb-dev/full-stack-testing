# Testing Remix

When our components are rendered, they are using a
[context provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
from Remix. When we try to render our components in our test, things like
`useLoaderData` and `<Link>` will expect to have that context available. The
tricky bit with Remix is that so much of what you're doing relies on the routing
layer which often involves loaders and actions.

So, the Remix team is working on a great solution for this called
`createRemixStub` which allows you to create a mini-Remix app that you can
render in your test and have all the routes you need for testing the component.
This is a work in progress, but should be released quite soon. As that is the
case, there is no documentation and the API we use has an `unstable_` prefix.
However, it's unlikely to experience many (or even any) breaking changes before
the release. Here are your "docs" for that:

```tsx filename=app/routes/counter.test.tsx
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { db } from 'utils/db.server'

export async function loader() {
	return json({ count: await db.getCount() })
}

export async function action() {
	await db.incrementCount()
	return redirect('/counter')
}

export default function Counter() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	return (
		<Form method="post">
			<button type="submit">Count: {data.count}</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

```tsx filename=app/counter.test.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { unstable_createRemixStub as createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'
import Counter from './counter'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	let count = 0
	const App = createRemixStub([
		{
			path: '/counter',
			element: Counter,
			loader: () => json({ count }),
			action: () => {
				count = count + 1
				return redirect('/counter')
			},
		},
	])
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
})
```

It's pretty neat that we can test the UI component with some mocked backend
logic, however, I'm often interested in testing the component holistically, so
we can actually import and use the original `action` and `loader` from the route
as well:

```tsx filename=app/counter.test.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
// 👇 import the loader and action
import Counter, { loader, action } from './counter'
import { unstable_createRemixStub as createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	const App = createRemixStub([
		{
			path: '/counter',
			element: Counter,
			// 👇 use the original loader and action
			loader,
			action,
		},
	])
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
})
```

The trick here is to make sure you've got a database working in your test, which
we'll cover more in the next exercise.

## Stubs

A stub is kind of like a mock in that it's a fake version of something. However,
a stub is a bit more lightweight and doesn't have the same assertions that a
mock does. A stub is just a function that returns a value. You can use a stub to
replace a function that you don't want to run in your test, or to return a
specific value that you want to test against. But it's not like a mock function
that you can say `expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` for example.

In our case, the Remix stub is just a fake version of Remix's context providers
so our components can render without errors and with preset values we specify.
