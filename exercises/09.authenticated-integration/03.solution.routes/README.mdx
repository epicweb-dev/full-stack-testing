# Assert Session

👨‍💼 Well done! Now we have great utilities for testing authenticated requests to
our resource routes like the GitHub callback and our full Remix routes like the
user profile page.

That was a lot of work! Why don't you take a break. When you come back I want to
have you improve some of our assertions...
