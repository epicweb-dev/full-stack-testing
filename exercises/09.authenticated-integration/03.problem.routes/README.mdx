# Authenticated Routes

👨‍💼 Remember how our tests using the Remix Stub were covering the UI but not the
`loader`s? We were just making test versions of those loaders. Well, now that
we know how to simulate an authenticated state, why don't we use the real
versions of those loaders and get confidence that the two work together well!

```sh nonumber
npx vitest username
